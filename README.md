## About the app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and was created by YouCode students:

-   [Dorota Borowska](https://github.com/IT2021db)
-   [Miłosz Zajączkowski](https://github.com/miloszzaj)
-   [Wojciech Kurdzielewicz](https://github.com/wojtekkkwojtek)

Our web application enables you to search and browse movies and people (actors and crew).

We implemented a wide range of technologies such as:

-   HTML,
-   CSS,
-   JavaScript (ES6+),
-   Styled Components,
-   React,
-   React Router,
-   React Redux,
-   Redux Saga,
-   and more...

The data comes from external [API](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

You can download this repository, but remember that to run the application you must have your own individual API Key.
To generate it, visit https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction and create your key. Detailed instructions can be found at the link provided.
Then create an .env file in the main folder and create a variable called "REACT_APP_API_KEY" and enter your key there.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
